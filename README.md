# Problem-Solving-in-Java

# Purpose

This repository is created for practice purpose. 
Practice code in java will be uploaded to this repository.

#Coding Practice
If anyone wants to build skill in running, he/she needs to run.
To build skill in code, we need to write code. 

In this repo, I am trying to concentrate on the coding with nothing else to get in the way.
Anyone can get a lot of coding practice done in just an hour or two.
I'm conscious that the problems do not have realistic stories to motivate what's going on.
Instead, they are stripped down to have short problem descriptions with little ambiguity.
It's just about lots of little problems to practice.

The problem statements are found in different open source coding practice sites. 
codingbat.com is one of those sites. 
Some of the problem statements are extracted from codingbat.com.
I tried to solve those problem statements for my coding practice purpose.
